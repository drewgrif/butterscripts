# ðŸ§ˆ butterscripts

A growing collection of scripts I use across my setups â€” mostly minimal, always practical.

This repo includes post-install tools, WM configs, binary installers, helper scripts, and more. Built with Butter Bean Linux in mind, but useful on any Debian-based system.

## ðŸ›  Categories

- `install/` â€“ Scripts for installing apps (e.g. Firefox, Discord, Zen browser)
- `setup/` â€“ System setup and post-install scripts (e.g. ZRAM, dotfiles, neovim config)
- `wm/` â€“ Scripts related to window manager setup (e.g. openbox, bspwm, sxhkd)
- `helpers/` â€“ Miscellaneous tools and utilities (e.g. wallpaper switchers, theme changers)

## ðŸ§© Highlights

- Binary installers that skip the bloat
- Rofi integration with Openbox/BSPWM
- ZRAM and Snapper-ready post-install setup
- Modular design â€” use what you want, ignore the rest

## ðŸ’» Usage

Clone the repo and run scripts manually, or include them in your own setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drewgrif/butterscripts ~/butterscripts
cd ~/butterscripts/install
./firefox-latest.sh
```

## ðŸŒ± Notes

- Most scripts assume a Debian base
- Light dependencies; check the top of each script if unsure
